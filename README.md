## Overview
DocLock is an innovative document storage platform designed to provide a secure and efficient solution for storing, managing, and verifying important documents using blockchain technology. In todayâ€™s digital age, data security and privacy are paramount, especially when dealing with sensitive information. DocLock addresses these concerns by employing a decentralized ledger system, which ensures that documents are not only securely stored but also immutable and verifiable.

### Key Features:
- **Decentralized Storage**: Unlike traditional document storage solutions, which rely on centralized servers, DocLock leverages blockchain technology to distribute document storage across a network of nodes. This decentralization enhances security by eliminating single points of failure and making unauthorized access virtually impossible.
  
- **Document Verification**: Each document stored in DocLock is hashed and recorded on the blockchain, creating a unique digital fingerprint. This allows users to verify the authenticity of documents easily, providing peace of mind that their information has not been altered or tampered with.

- **User-Centric Control**: Users retain full control over their documents. With the ability to grant or revoke access permissions, DocLock ensures that sensitive information is only available to authorized individuals. This user-centric approach promotes trust and confidentiality.

- **Enhanced Privacy**: Built with privacy in mind, DocLock employs advanced encryption techniques to protect user data. Even in a decentralized environment, users can be confident that their documents are safe from unauthorized access and breaches.

- **Robust Document Management**: The platform is designed to streamline the process of document management. Users can easily upload, store, and retrieve documents while maintaining an organized and user-friendly interface.

DocLock aims to revolutionize the way individuals and organizations manage sensitive documents by providing a reliable, secure, and user-friendly solution that adapts to the evolving needs of today's digital landscape.

## The asset transfer basic sample demonstrates:

- Connecting a client application to a Fabric blockchain network.
- Submitting smart contract transactions to update ledger state.
- Evaluating smart contract transactions to query ledger state.
- Handling errors in transaction invocation.

## About the sample

This sample includes smart contract and application code in multiple languages. This sample shows create, read, update, transfer and delete of an asset.

For a more detailed walk-through of the application code and client API usage, refer to the [Running a Fabric Application tutorial](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/write_first_app.html) in the main Hyperledger Fabric documentation.

### Application

Follow the execution flow in the client application code, and corresponding output on running the application. Pay attention to the sequence of:

- Transaction invocations (console output like "**--> Submit Transaction**" and "**--> Evaluate Transaction**").
- Results returned by transactions (console output like "**\*\*\* Result**").

### Smart Contract

The smart contract (in folder `chaincode-xyz`) implements the following functions to support the application:

- CreateAsset
- ReadAsset
- UpdateAsset
- DeleteAsset
- TransferAsset

Note that the asset transfer implemented by the smart contract is a simplified scenario, without ownership validation, meant only to demonstrate how to invoke transactions.

## Running the sample

The Fabric test network is used to deploy and run this sample. Follow these steps in order:

1. Create the test network and a channel (from the `test-network` folder).
   ```
   ./network.sh up createChannel -c mychannel -ca
   ```

1. Deploy one of the smart contract implementations (from the `test-network` folder).
   ```
   # To deploy the  chaincode implementation
   ./network.sh deployCC -ccn basic -ccp ../asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-javascript/ -ccl javascript
   ```

1. Run the application (from the `asset-transfer-basic` folder).
   ```
   # To run the Typescript sample application
   cd application-gateway-typescript
   npm install
   npm start

   # To run the Go sample application
   cd application-gateway-go
   go run .

   # To run the Java sample application
   cd application-gateway-java
   ./gradlew run
   ```

## Clean up

When you are finished, you can bring down the test network (from the `test-network` folder). The command will remove all the nodes of the test network, and delete any ledger data that you created.

```
./network.sh down
```

# Hyperledger Fabric Samples : Learning Guide

You can use Fabric samples to get started working with Hyperledger Fabric, explore important Fabric features, and learn how to build applications that can interact with blockchain networks using the Fabric SDKs. To learn more about Hyperledger Fabric, visit the [Fabric documentation](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

Note that this branch contains samples for the latest Fabric release. For older Fabric versions, refer to the corresponding branches:

- [release-2.2](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-2.2)
- [release-1.4](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-1.4)

## Getting started with the Fabric samples

To use the Fabric samples, you need to download the Fabric Docker images and the Fabric CLI tools. First, make sure that you have installed all of the [Fabric prerequisites](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prereqs.html). You can then follow the instructions to [Install the Fabric Samples, Binaries, and Docker Images](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) in the Fabric documentation. In addition to downloading the Fabric images and tool binaries, the Fabric samples will also be cloned to your local machine.

## Test network

The [Fabric test network](test-network) in the samples repository provides a Docker Compose based test network with two
Organization peers and an ordering service node. You can use it on your local machine to run the samples listed below.
You can also use it to deploy and test your own Fabric chaincodes and applications. To get started, see
the [test network tutorial](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_network.html).

The [Kubernetes Test Network](test-network-k8s) sample builds upon the Compose network, constructing a Fabric
network with peer, orderer, and CA infrastructure nodes running on Kubernetes.  In addition to providing a sample
Kubernetes guide, the Kube test network can be used as a platform to author and debug _cloud ready_ Fabric Client
applications on a development or CI workstation.


## Asset transfer samples and tutorials

The asset transfer series provides a series of sample smart contracts and applications to demonstrate how to store and transfer assets using Hyperledger Fabric.
Each sample and associated tutorial in the series demonstrates a different core capability in Hyperledger Fabric. The **Basic** sample provides an introduction on how
to write smart contracts and how to interact with a Fabric network using the Fabric SDKs. The **Ledger queries**, **Private data**, and **State-based endorsement**
samples demonstrate these additional capabilities. Finally, the **Secured agreement** sample demonstrates how to bring all the capabilities together to securely
transfer an asset in a more realistic transfer scenario.
