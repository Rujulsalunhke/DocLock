## Overview
DocLock is an innovative document storage platform designed to provide a secure and efficient solution for storing, managing, and verifying important documents using blockchain technology. In todayâ€™s digital age, data security and privacy are paramount, especially when dealing with sensitive information. DocLock addresses these concerns by employing a decentralized ledger system, which ensures that documents are not only securely stored but also immutable and verifiable.

### Key Features:
- **Decentralized Storage**: Unlike traditional document storage solutions, which rely on centralized servers, DocLock leverages blockchain technology to distribute document storage across a network of nodes. This decentralization enhances security by eliminating single points of failure and making unauthorized access virtually impossible.
  
- **Document Verification**: Each document stored in DocLock is hashed and recorded on the blockchain, creating a unique digital fingerprint. This allows users to verify the authenticity of documents easily, providing peace of mind that their information has not been altered or tampered with.

- **User-Centric Control**: Users retain full control over their documents. With the ability to grant or revoke access permissions, DocLock ensures that sensitive information is only available to authorized individuals. This user-centric approach promotes trust and confidentiality.

- **Enhanced Privacy**: Built with privacy in mind, DocLock employs advanced encryption techniques to protect user data. Even in a decentralized environment, users can be confident that their documents are safe from unauthorized access and breaches.

- **Robust Document Management**: The platform is designed to streamline the process of document management. Users can easily upload, store, and retrieve documents while maintaining an organized and user-friendly interface.

DocLock aims to revolutionize the way individuals and organizations manage sensitive documents by providing a reliable, secure, and user-friendly solution that adapts to the evolving needs of today's digital landscape.


## The asset transfer basic sample demonstrates:

- Connecting a client application to a Fabric blockchain network.
- Submitting smart contract transactions to update ledger state.
- Evaluating smart contract transactions to query ledger state.
- Handling errors in transaction invocation.

## About the sample

This sample includes smart contract and application code in multiple languages. This sample shows create, read, update, transfer and delete of an asset.

For a more detailed walk-through of the application code and client API usage, refer to the [Running a Fabric Application tutorial](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/write_first_app.html) in the main Hyperledger Fabric documentation.

### Application

Follow the execution flow in the client application code, and corresponding output on running the application. Pay attention to the sequence of:

- Transaction invocations (console output like "**--> Submit Transaction**" and "**--> Evaluate Transaction**").
- Results returned by transactions (console output like "**\*\*\* Result**").

### Smart Contract

The smart contract (in folder `chaincode-xyz`) implements the following functions to support the application:

- CreateAsset
- ReadAsset
- UpdateAsset
- DeleteAsset
- TransferAsset

Note that the asset transfer implemented by the smart contract is a simplified scenario, without ownership validation, meant only to demonstrate how to invoke transactions.

## Running the sample

The Fabric test network is used to deploy and run this sample. Follow these steps in order:

1. Create the test network and a channel (from the `test-network` folder).
   ```
   ./network.sh up createChannel -c mychannel -ca
   ```

1. Deploy one of the smart contract implementations (from the `test-network` folder).
   ```
   # To deploy the  chaincode implementation
   ./network.sh deployCC -ccn basic -ccp ../asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-javascript/ -ccl javascript
   ```

1. Run the application (from the `asset-transfer-basic` folder).
   ```
   # To run the Typescript sample application
   cd application-gateway-typescript
   npm install
   npm start

   # To run the Go sample application
   cd application-gateway-go
   go run .

   # To run the Java sample application
   cd application-gateway-java
   ./gradlew run
   ```

## Clean up

When you are finished, you can bring down the test network (from the `test-network` folder). The command will remove all the nodes of the test network, and delete any ledger data that you created.

```
./network.sh down
```


## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this guide, you should have:
- **Basic understanding of blockchain technology**
